# itpm_pro - health care management system
The Medical Management System is a powerful application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to streamline hospital and clinic management. It allows for efficient handling of various medical processes such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, doctor management, prescription tracking, and maintaining electronic health records (EHR). The system incorporates role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users (such as admins, doctors, and patients) can access sensitive data. It also provides a dashboard for administrators to manage users, generate reports, and monitor system activity. Using React for a dynamic and responsive frontend and Node.js with Express for a robust backend, this system offers a seamless, user-friendly experience while leveraging MongoDB as the database to store and manage all medical data securely. The Medical Management System helps improve operational efficiency, enhances communication between patients and healthcare providers, and contributes to overall better healthcare management.
